# Changelog

This is an **append-only** project history. Once an entry is written, it is
never edited or removed — only new entries get added, at the bottom. If a
past decision turns out to be wrong or gets reversed, that reversal is its
own new entry ("X, reversing the 2026-07-09 decision to Y"), not a rewrite
of the original one. The goal is a record that survives context loss across
sessions — anyone (human or Claude) picking this file up cold should be able
to reconstruct what happened and why without re-deriving it.

For the current backlog/roadmap (as opposed to history), see `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

## 2026-07-08 — Initial scaffold and ported foundations

Project started as **Tidyarr**, later renamed (see 2026-07-09 entry). Initial
commits: Go server skeleton, SQLite + goose migrations, AGPL-3.0 license.
Ported `internal/servarr` (Radarr/Sonarr/Whisparr client), `internal/identify`
+ `internal/ollama` + `internal/stashapi` (the AI-assisted Adult
identification pipeline) from two prior sibling CLI projects
(`sonarr-radarr-sort`, `stash-whisparr-sort`). Added `internal/secrets`
(encrypted-at-rest) and `internal/connections` (persisted service
credentials, with real reachability checks for StashDB/FansDB/TPDB/Brave).
Confirmed Whisparr V3's actual API shape against real Whisparr-Eros source
rather than assuming.

Same day: implemented all four original review workflows end-to-end for
Movies/Series (and progressively Adult) — **Rename** (Scan→stage→Apply
against Radarr/Sonarr/Whisparr Lookup), **Purge** (allowlist-tag-based
Scan→stage→Apply), **Dedup** (quality-based duplicate grouping), **Tag**
(native tag assign/remove). Adult's own Rename/Dedup landed the same day:
Rename via the AI identification pipeline (Scan proposes, Apply carries the
resolved scene id to Whisparr); Dedup groups Whisparr scenes by `foreignId`
with graceful degradation. Unmatched Adult identifications can be given back
to TPDB/StashDB as scene drafts — a separate, explicitly human-triggered
action, not automatic.

## 2026-07-09 — Frontend, auth, Docker, rename to SAK, Movies off Radarr, Series off Sonarr

Built a real frontend (the review workflows could finally be exercised
end-to-end, not just via curl). Gated the app behind a single-operator login
with an enforced setup wizard. Added a Debian-based Dockerfile + dev loop
script. Added AI title-guess fallback for Movies/Series Rename (sharing
Adult's configured AI provider/model) and Kids/general content
classification with physical relocation, including drift reconciliation for
already-tracked items, not just new orphans.

**Renamed the project from Tidyarr to SAK Media Server** (module path,
Docker image, GitHub repo all updated to `sakms`).

Added native indexer search + grab (Prowlarr + qBittorrent/NZBGet) and a
TMDB-powered Discover browse UI — shared infrastructure across Movies and
Series, independent of any `*arr` app.

**Eliminated Radarr for Movies**: Movies gained its own library
(`internal/library`), with its own Rename/Purge/Dedup/Tag paths and its own
root-folder + quality-tier settings, no Radarr involved anywhere in the
Movies path anymore.

Added `CLAUDE.md` — the project's mission, scope, and load-bearing
engineering conventions (staged-for-approval one-item-at-a-time; secrets
encrypted at rest; single-operator auth; honesty about unverified
assumptions; house HTTP client pattern; no premature abstraction; no dead
code left behind, but don't strip still-generically-valid capability).

**Eliminated Sonarr for Series**: Series gained its own episode-aware
library (genuinely different tables from Movies' `Item` — `Series`/`Episode`,
since Series needs rows for episodes TMDB knows about but that aren't on
disk yet). Own Rename/Purge paths, own root-folder + quality-tier settings,
own episode/season-aware Search→grab→check-import. A one-time,
human-triggered importer (`internal/sonarrimport`) migrates an existing
Sonarr library by walking disk + resolving TVDB→TMDB ids, read-only against
Sonarr, safe to re-run.

**Added Series Dedup**: duplicates group by `(show TMDB id, season,
episode)` rather than a single id — the tracked copy for a key is the one
`library.Episode` row for that exact slot (the schema's own
`UNIQUE(series_id, season_number, episode_number)` constraint rules out
ambiguity), and a season-pack duplicate groups naturally with a loose
single-episode duplicate since a pack is broken into individual files before
grouping happens.

## 2026-07-10 — Stage 2c: recursive scanning, Season-0 fix, schema-aware Rename, Jellyfin/Emby naming

Four related fixes/features shipped together:

1. **`library.ScanRootFolder` made recursive** (`filepath.WalkDir` instead of
   a single-level `os.ReadDir`). Fixed a real bug: once any file in a folder
   was tracked, the *entire* wrapping folder was previously masked from ever
   being rescanned — a new season added later, or a new file dropped
   alongside something already tracked, was invisible forever. Rename and
   Dedup (Movies and Series) inherit the fix automatically. Purge never
   walked the filesystem at all, so needed no change. A directory is now
   reported whole only if it has no real subdirectories (ignoring
   bonus-content names like `Sample`/`Extras`, tracked in
   `config.ExcludedDirNames`) and no already-known direct children;
   otherwise it's opened up and recursed into.

2. **Season-0/Specials sentinel bug fixed**: `grabs.Grab` gained a
   `SeasonSpecified bool` field (migration `0014`). Previously,
   `SeasonNumber == 0` was treated as "no season info" during Search's
   check-import, which silently dropped a deliberate Season-0 (Specials)
   grab whose filename didn't parse. The fix also caught a matching frontend
   bug: `seasonNumber ? {...} : {}` made "season 0 typed deliberately" and
   "season left blank entirely" produce byte-identical wire payloads — the
   naive fix (just deleting the `== 0` check) would have been unsafe without
   also fixing this, since it would have started silently misfiling
   unidentifiable plain series-wide grabs as Season-0 episodes. Caught by
   adversarial review during planning, not after the fact.

3. **Schema-conformance filtering for Rename**: new
   `naming.MatchesMovieSchema`/`MatchesSeriesSchema` structural predicates —
   a file/folder that already matches the active naming preset is never
   re-proposed by Rename's Scan, even if it was never tracked in the
   database (e.g. a library someone already organized by hand).

4. **New `internal/naming` package**: a small, fixed set of on-disk naming
   presets — `Jellyfin` (default: `Title (Year) [tmdbid-N]` folders/files,
   space-separated episode names, matching Jellyfin/Emby's documented
   convention) and `Legacy` (this project's original dash-separated Series
   shape, no tag on Movies — an explicit opt-in so an already-renamed
   library's shape never silently changes after an upgrade). **Movies gets
   real renaming for the first time** here — before this, Movies' Rename
   only ever relocated a file, preserving whatever scene-release name it
   arrived with. Configurable per-mode via `GET/PUT
   /api/modes/{mode}/naming-preset`. `proposals.Proposal` gained a `Year`
   field (migration `0015`, populated from TMDB at Scan time), finally
   populating the previously-dead `library.Item.Year`/`library.Series.Year`
   columns on Apply.

Verified via `go build/vet/test -race` across the whole module (all green)
plus a live Playwright walkthrough proving Jellyfin-standard renaming
actually happens on disk for both Movies and Series, the naming-preset
setting persists per-mode, and — the key regression proof — a new episode
file dropped into an already-organized, already-tracked season folder is
correctly discovered on rescan.

## 2026-07-10 — Redesign discussion begins (no code shipped yet)

User shared five UI mockup images depicting a much richer dashboard-style
redesign than SAK's current lightweight single-page tab UI (sidebar nav,
system dashboard, table-driven workflows with bulk actions, poster-grid
tagging). Full description of each mockup is recorded in `docs/ROADMAP.md`
under "UI mockup reference" for durability, since the images themselves
aren't stored as files.

Decided: treat the mockups as inspiration, not a literal spec — real SAK
terminology (Movies/Series/Adult, actual workflow names), only build widgets
backed by data SAK actually has. Sequencing decided: finish the
already-in-flight Stage 2c work (above) before starting on the redesign.

Follow-up discussion ("deep-interview") reviewed 13 additional candidate
capabilities across Core Media Management, Infrastructure, Automation, and
Metadata Sourcing. Key decisions from that round:
- **Naming overhaul** (token/regex-based custom renaming): dropped from
  scope for now — user will revisit later if needed. `internal/naming`'s
  fixed-preset design (from Stage 2c, above) stands as-is.
- **Bulk apply**: decided to actually build this (a deliberate, considered
  reversal of the "no apply-everything path anywhere" principle in
  `CLAUDE.md` — needs its own design pass for partial-failure handling, not
  a casual add).
- **SSO**: forward-auth header support only (trusting a reverse-proxy-set
  identity header), not a full OIDC/SAML client — keeps SAK single-operator.
- **Network mount resiliency**: verified already safe. No workflow deletes
  anything in reaction to a missing file — Purge triggers on tag membership
  only, Dedup only removes a *detected duplicate's* loser, Rename never
  deletes. A disconnected mount just errors the scan or skips an unreadable
  subdirectory. Only gap: clearer error messaging, not a redesign.
- **Hardware acceleration (GPU)**: initially flagged as a scope mismatch
  (SAK doesn't transcode or generate thumbnails today) — then reopened with
  a concrete driver, see the phash entry below.
- **Background task queue**: not building speculatively; only if/when
  watch-folders (see Automation below) actually need it.
- **Confirmed real gaps, not yet scheduled**: confidence scoring for weak
  TMDB/community-DB matches (today `items[0]` is always taken, no
  threshold); manual override/re-pick for a misidentified match; logical
  episode-splitting (one file, multiple `Episode` rows — explicitly NOT
  physical re-encoding); TVDB/IMDB as fallback metadata sources alongside
  TMDB; local `.nfo`/artwork preference (confirmed zero support today —
  `.nfo` is purely skip-listed, never parsed); watch-folders (would only
  ever auto-run Scan, never auto-Apply — that would break the one invariant
  this whole project is built on); webhooks + real API docs (the REST API
  already *is* the extensibility surface; GraphQL explicitly rejected as an
  unnecessary rewrite); Collections (Movies-only, seeded from TMDB's
  `belongs_to_collection` — Series has no TMDB equivalent); structured
  Genre/Actor tagging (richer than today's flat per-mode tag vocabulary).

## 2026-07-10 — Phash-based duplicate detection: scope decided, split into two efforts

User: perceptual hashing (phash) should be "the defacto standard across all
media for identifying duplicates," and specifically that Adult identification
against StashDB/TPDB/FansDB should already have this (`borrowed from stash`).

**Verified, not assumed**: the claim was correct and more precise than
expected. The prior CLI this project descended from
(`stash-whisparr-sort`) had phash as the **primary, authoritative**
identification signal for Adult content — files with a phash matched via a
StashDB→FansDB→TPDB-GraphQL fingerprint cascade first, falling back to
AI/text search only for files without one yet (with a force-generate step
that triggered a targeted Stash rescan for missing phashes before falling
back). When ported into this codebase, the low-level client methods came
along verbatim (`stashbox.FindScenesByFingerprints`, `stashbox.SubmitFingerprint`,
`tpdbrest.SearchByHash`, `stashapi.StashFile.PHash`) but the *orchestration*
that made phash primary did not — today's `internal/identify.Identifier.Identify`
is pure UUID-lookup + AI-parsed-title text search + web-search grounding,
never touching a hash. The dead client methods are exercised only by their
own unit tests.

Also surfaced a subtlety while verifying: the old CLI's own code comment
claimed a 4-stage cascade (`...→TPDB-GraphQL→TPDB-REST`), but the actual
implementation only ever queried 3 stages — TPDB-REST was never part of the
fingerprint cascade, only used for AI-fallback text search. The restoration
will implement the real 3-stage cascade, not the comment's stale claim.

Also clarified: **the old CLI never computed a phash itself** — it always
read one already computed by the user's own separately-running Stash
instance, and forced Stash to compute one (via a targeted rescan) when
missing. This splits "phash as the defacto standard across all media" into
two genuinely different efforts:

1. **Adult identification** (in progress — design finalized, not yet
   implemented): restore the phash-first cascade, leaning on Stash's own
   already-computed fingerprint via a new `mode.Session.Stash *stashapi.Client`
   field (reusing the already-recognized, already-testable `"stash"`
   connection key that exists but was never wired into a live session).
   Give-back (submitting a confirmed fingerprint back to StashDB/FansDB)
   moves from Scan-time (as in the old CLI) to Apply-time, since Scan only
   ever proposes in this project — submitting to a community database based
   on an unapproved proposal would violate staged-for-approval.
2. **Movies/Series Dedup** (deferred, not yet designed in detail): there's
   no Stash instance for Movies/Series to lean on, so SAK would need to
   compute phashes itself for the first time in either codebase — real
   frame-decode work. Decided: CPU baseline by default, GPU (QuickSync/NVENC)
   as an opt-in speedup, scoped comparison to start (not full library
   all-pairs), across all three modes including Adult once available.

This is where the GPU-acceleration item from the deep-interview round
reopened: it's a real, well-motivated need for effort #2's frame decoding,
not the vague "transcoding" scope mismatch it looked like in isolation.

User also requested this changelog and `docs/ROADMAP.md` be created and
kept up going forward, given the volume of undocumented decisions
accumulating in conversation alone.
