// Scheme tags every hash this package produces with the algorithm and frame
// count that produced it. A value cached under a different algorithm or
// sampling count is therefore self-identifying and treated as incomparable by
// SimilarityWithin, never silently mis-distanced. It is embedded in the stored
// hash string (see internal/db migration 0017 + internal/library threading),
// so a scheme change makes every cached value self-invalidating. Exported so
// the dedup cache layer can cheaply reject a stale-scheme cached hash by prefix
// before trusting a size+mtime identity match.
//
// This file is the SINGLE algorithm swap point. It ships imghash/v2's PHash
// (64 bits/frame); swapping to PDQ changes only newAlgo, hashFrame, and this
// Scheme constant — nothing downstream, which is algorithm-agnostic (hashes
// are compared as scheme-tagged byte composites by Hamming distance regardless
// of which algorithm produced them).
const Scheme = "phash64/5f"

// Frames is the fixed number of evenly-spaced interior frames sampled per
// video to form one composite hash. Exported so the dedup layer can express
// its similarity threshold as a per-frame average, independent of this count.

// newAlgo constructs the perceptual-hash algorithm. Called from Hash (not
// New) deliberately: v2's constructor returns an error (NewPHash() (PHash,
// error)), and Hash already returns an error, so the swap stays isolated to
// this file instead of rippling into New's signature. Constructed with zero
// options, which yields imghash/v2's default PHash (32x32 downscale, 8x8 DCT
// block → 64-bit hash).

	return imghash.NewPHash()

// hashFrame returns the per-frame perceptual hash bytes for one decoded image.
// v2's PHash.Calculate returns a hashtype.Hash interface plus an error; for
// PHash the concrete value is a hashtype.Binary (type Binary []byte), so the
// result is type-asserted to it before extracting the raw bytes.

// hammingBits is a plain popcount over the XOR of two equal-length byte

// semantics (raw bit count vs. a normalized fraction) could not be confirmed
// from its docs. A popcount is algorithm-agnostic and correct regardless of
// what any third-party helper returns, so distance.go never depends on
// unverified upstream semantics. Callers guarantee len(a) == len(b).
