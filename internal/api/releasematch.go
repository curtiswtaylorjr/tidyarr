// AI-escalation bounds — found missing entirely in an earlier version of
// this function, which caused a real production hang: a plain sequential
// loop over EVERY raw release (no count cap, no concurrency, no phase
// deadline beyond the shared httpClient's already-generous 15s per-call
// timeout) meant a search returning 20-30 releases with a fast-path miss
// could block the request for several minutes, and the frontend's fetch
// wrapper has no client-side timeout either — a real "selecting titles
// hangs checking availability" bug, not a hypothetical one. These three
// bounds compose to cap the whole phase's worst case regardless of how
// many releases came back or how slow any individual AI call is:
// ceil(maxAIEscalationCandidates/aiEscalationConcurrency) batches, each
// bounded by aiEscalationTimeout (which cancels in-flight HTTP requests
// via context — every AIClient implementation already uses
// http.NewRequestWithContext, so this isn't just a client-side abandon).
const (
	// maxAIEscalationCandidates bounds how many raw releases ever get an AI
	// call — escalating every release in a large result set defeats "keep
	// the common case fast." Only the first N (Prowlarr's own relevance
	// ordering) are checked; this is a documented tradeoff, not a claim that
	// AI-checking more would never help.

// languageTagPattern is a small, explicit, deterministic token list marking

// uses), so a release is only rejected when one of these tags is actually
// present in the title, never guessed absent. This is NOT a user-facing
// preference/setting (the plan is explicit: "don't build speculative config
// ahead of proven need") — easy to make configurable later if it's ever
// wrong for someone. Word-boundary matched, case-insensitive, mirroring
// internal/release.Parse's own regexp convention for title-token matching.

// FilterReleases applies the Discover detail-popup plan's title-match +
// language filter pass to raw Prowlarr releases before any tier/protocol
// grading — the popup's search needs this because a raw title/ID-scoped
// Prowlarr search returns "widely varied" results (wrong language, loosely-
// matched titles), and without this pass the availability signal would be
// noisy garbage (see the plan's Context section).
//
// Two-stage title match, built on internal/identify's already-existing
// pieces rather than a fresh regex title-cleaner:
//
//  1. Fast path (always runs, no AI call): internal/identify.TitleSimilarity
//     against targetTitle vs. each candidate's raw release title — already
//     tested, already tuned for this exact comparison.
//  2. AI-escalation path (only reached when the fast path kept ZERO
//     candidates): mirrors internal/identify.Identify's own cheap-first,
//     AI-as-escalation structure. Runs ONLY when aiClient is non-nil — a nil
//     client (AI features not configured, the tolerant-nil convention every
//     mode.Session client already follows) degrades cleanly to "no
//     candidates," never an error.
//
// Argument order for TitleSimilarity calls follows
// internal/identify.ExtractFromSearch's own established convention
// (TitleSimilarity(extracted.Title, stem)): the shorter, canonical/clean
// title first, the longer/noisier scene-release-style title second — this
// is what lets TitleSimilarity's containment shortcut (see its doc comment)
// recognize "every token of the canonical title appears somewhere in this
// noisy release title" rather than falling back to a plain Jaccard score
// that a short canonical title against a long noisy one would otherwise
// score low on.
//
// Then, regardless of which title-match stage produced the surviving set, a
// deterministic language-tag filter (hasLanguageTag) drops any release
// carrying a non-English tag. Order preserved; prowlarr.Release fields are
// passed through unchanged so the caller can still pair filtered releases'
// indices 1:1 with a derived []autograb.Candidate slice (see
// buildAutoGrabCandidates's existing index-pairing convention, which this
// filter's output feeds into unchanged).

// for scene-release filenames, which is exactly what a Prowlarr release
// title also looks like) and the cleaned title is re-compared via
// TitleSimilarity. A per-candidate AI failure (a real error, OR
// GuessTitle/ParseFilename's own "declined to guess" empty-title result)
// just drops that one candidate — it never fails the whole filter, matching
// the "no candidates" degrade-cleanly requirement.
//
// Bounded on three axes at once (see the consts' doc comment above) so this
