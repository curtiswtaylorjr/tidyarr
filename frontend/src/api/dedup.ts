// Dedup workflow data access (Stage 3). Ported verbatim from the vanilla-JS
// frontend (internal/web/static/index.html's renderDedup). Dedup is the staged
// scan→propose→apply DEDUPLICATION queue: Scan finds content identified twice
// (an already-tracked copy plus one or more orphan files that resolve to the
// SAME identity) and enqueues one proposal PER DUPLICATE GROUP, each carrying
// the group's candidate files with the quality winner pre-flagged. The operator
// reviews each group and resolves EXACTLY ONE group per Apply click — there is
// no apply-all/resolve-all path across the queue, matching the old frontend and
// the project's no-bulk-action invariant.
//
// Structurally DIFFERENT from Rename and Purge (verified against the old
// frontend, do NOT "align" them): a Rename/Purge proposal is a single flat row
// acted on with an empty body; a Dedup proposal is a GROUP of candidate files
// (proposal.candidates), and Apply carries a body identifying which candidate to
// keep. What a "duplicate" is differs by MODE at Scan time only — Movies group
// by TMDB id, Series by (show, season, episode), Adult by (box, scene_id) — but
// the wire shape and this client are mode-agnostic: every mode returns the same
// group-of-candidates Proposal and resolves through the same /api/proposals
// route (proposal.workflow, set at Scan time, dispatches to the right backend
// Apply — dedup.ApplyLibrary / ApplyLibrarySeries / ApplyLibraryAdult).
//
// Every call goes through api() (src/api/client.ts) so it inherits the session
// cookie and the global 401 → re-boot session-expiry fallback. Response/request
// shapes are the generated DTOs (@dto), never hand-duplicated (plan Guardrail #4).
