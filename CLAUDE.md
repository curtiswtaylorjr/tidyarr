# SAK Media Server — project guidance

This file orients any session (yours or a future one) picking this project
back up. Read it before making scope decisions, not just implementation
ones — it captures the *why* behind choices already made, so you don't
re-litigate settled questions or, worse, quietly reverse them.

## Mission

Consolidate the redundant single-purpose apps a self-hosted media setup
normally runs (Radarr, Sonarr, Whisparr, Prowlarr, download clients, and
whatever else accumulates around them) into one application. The problem
isn't just that running N containers wastes resources — each one carries
its own base OS image, its own config surface, its own auth, its own
partial view of "the library." That fragmentation is *why* libraries stay
messy even when every individual tool is doing its job correctly: no tool
owns the seams between them, so drift, duplicates, and inconsistent
organization accumulate in the gaps between apps that each only see their
own narrow slice.

**A clean library means the filesystem is exactly as organized as the UI
says it is — no drift between them — and there are no duplicates.** If
SAK's own records say a title is tracked and placed at a given path, that
path is correct and current, right now, not "eventually consistent" after
some reconciliation pass. This is the concrete, checkable bar every
workflow (Rename, Purge, Dedup, Tag, Search/grab) is ultimately in service
of.

## Scope: opportunistic, not a fixed roadmap

There is **no committed target list** of what SAK will eventually absorb.
Radarr is eliminated for Movies (done); Sonarr is eliminated for Series,
including Series Dedup (done). Whether Jellyfin, Stash, Bazarr, Tdarr, or
anything else ever gets absorbed is an open question, decided app-by-app
as the pain of running it separately becomes concrete — not decided in
advance by a roadmap. When a new consolidation opportunity comes up,
engage with it on its own merits; don't cite (or invent) a fixed
end-state that includes or excludes it a priori.

## Automation: manual by default, scheduling earns its way back in

Every workflow SAK has built so far is human-triggered: Scan proposes,
a person approves, Apply commits exactly that one item — no bulk actions,
no background pollers, no scheduler infrastructure exists anywhere in this
codebase today. That's the default for anything new, too — **don't build
speculative scheduling ahead of proven manual usage.**

But this isn't a permanent ban on automation. The *arr apps automate
things (RSS, scheduled searches, quality-cutoff upgrades) safely and
well — once a piece of SAK's manual workflow has been used enough to be
trusted, scheduled automation for that specific piece is a legitimate,
considered upgrade, not a betrayal of the human-in-the-loop principle.
The sequencing matters: manual and proven first, scheduled second, never
the other way around.

## Established engineering conventions

These aren't just style preferences — they're load-bearing for the mission
above, so don't drop them for convenience:

- **Staged-for-approval, one item at a time.** Every mutating action
  (Apply, grab, tag) acts on exactly one already-approved thing. There is
  no "apply everything" path anywhere, by design.
- **Secrets encrypted at rest** (`internal/secrets`, a locally generated
  key file, not an OS keychain — the primary deployment target is a
  headless container with no keychain to use).
- **Single-operator auth**, not multi-tenant. No permissions system, no
  per-user roles — one login gates the whole app.
- **Honesty about unverified assumptions.** When a client's response shape
  is modeled from documentation but not confirmed against a live instance,
  say so explicitly in the package doc — don't present a guess as fact.
- **House HTTP client pattern**: `Config` struct + `Client{cfg, http}` +
  `func New(cfg, httpClient) *Client`, hand-built requests, no interfaces
  for external clients — testable via a concrete `*Client` against
  `httptest.NewServer`. Reserve interfaces for cases where two genuinely
  different concrete backends must satisfy the same internal contract
  (e.g. a workflow package's Servarr-backed path vs. its library-backed
  path) — and even then, prefer parallel sibling functions over a shared
  interface until a second real caller proves the abstraction is worth it.
- **No premature abstraction.** A new backend (e.g. Movies' own library)
  gets its own sibling functions in each workflow package rather than a
  forced-shared code path with the thing it's replacing — especially
  while the replacement (e.g. Series/Sonarr) isn't designed yet and might
  not fit the same shape.
- **No dead code left behind.** When a capability stops being used (e.g.
  Radarr for Movies), remove the application-level wiring that only
  existed to serve it — but don't strip generic, still-valid capability
  from a shared library (e.g. `internal/servarr` keeping Radarr support
  even though `mode.Build` no longer constructs one) just because one
  caller moved on.

## Current state (update this as stages land)

- **Movies**: fully off Radarr. Owns its own library (`internal/library`),
  own Rename/Purge/Dedup/Tag paths, own root-folder + quality-tier
  settings. Search/grab (Prowlarr + qBittorrent/NZBGet) and Discover
  (TMDB) are shared infrastructure, already live for both Movies and
  Series.
- **Series**: fully off Sonarr. Owns its own episode-aware library
  (`internal/library`'s `Series`/`Episode` types — genuinely different
  tables from Movies' `Item`, since Series needs rows for episodes TMDB
  knows about but that aren't on disk yet, to make "missing episodes" a
  real query; see `internal/library`'s package doc). Own
  ScanLibrarySeries/ApplyLibrarySeries Rename and Purge paths, own
  root-folder + quality-tier settings, own episode/season-aware Search →
  grab → check-import. A one-time, human-triggered importer
  (`internal/sonarrimport`, "Import from Sonarr" in Settings) migrates an
  existing Sonarr library by walking disk directly + resolving TVDB→TMDB
  ids via TMDB's `/find` endpoint — read-only against Sonarr, safe to
  re-run. `internal/servarr`'s Sonarr support is kept (still a valid
  generic capability, same precedent as Radarr) even though nothing in
  `mode.Build` constructs one anymore. Series Dedup is built too
  (`dedup.ScanLibrarySeries`/`ApplyLibrarySeries`): duplicates group by
  `(show TMDB id, season, episode)` rather than a single id — "the tracked
  copy" for a key is just the one `library.Episode` row for that exact
  slot (the schema's own `UNIQUE(series_id, season_number,
  episode_number)` constraint rules out ambiguity), and a season-pack
  duplicate groups with a loose single-episode duplicate naturally, since
  a pack is broken into individual files
  (`library.ResolveEpisodeVideoFiles`) before grouping happens.
- **Adult (Whisparr)**: untouched, not in any near-term plan.
- **Jellyfin**: not integrated as a service, but its documented naming
  convention is now SAK's own default (see below) — no live Jellyfin
  connection exists or is planned; whether one ever gets added is still
  genuinely undecided (see Scope above).
- **Naming, scanning, and Season-0 (Stage 2c)**:
  - `library.ScanRootFolder` is now recursive (`filepath.WalkDir`,
    `internal/library/library.go`) — a directory is reported whole only if
    it has no real subdirectories (ignoring bonus-content names in
    `config.ExcludedDirNames`) and no already-known direct children;
    otherwise it's opened up. Fixes a real bug: previously, once any
    episode of a show (or file of a movie) was tracked, the entire
    wrapping folder was masked from ever being rescanned — a new season,
    or a new file dropped alongside a tracked one, was invisible forever.
    Rename and Dedup (Movies and Series) all inherit this fix for free;
    Purge never walked the filesystem, so it needed no change.
  - `internal/naming` is a new package: a small, fixed set of on-disk
    naming presets — `Jellyfin` (default: `Title (Year) [tmdbid-N]`
    folders/files, space-separated episode names) and `Legacy` (this
    project's original dash-separated Series shape, no tag on Movies).
    Configurable per-mode via `GET/PUT /api/modes/{mode}/naming-preset`.
    Movies gets real renaming for the first time (`rename.RelocateMovie`)
    — before this, Movies' Rename only ever relocated a file, preserving
    whatever scene-release name it arrived with.
  - `naming.MatchesMovieSchema`/`MatchesSeriesSchema` are structural
    conformance checks wired into `rename.ScanLibrary`/`ScanLibrarySeries`:
    a file/folder that already matches the active preset is never
    proposed, even if it was never in `libStore` (e.g. a library someone
    already organized by hand).
  - `proposals.Proposal.Year` (new field, populated from TMDB's release
    date at Scan time) finally populates the previously-dead
    `library.Item.Year`/`library.Series.Year` columns on Apply.
  - `grabs.Grab.SeasonSpecified` (new field) fixes a real Season-0/
    Specials bug: `SeasonNumber == 0` used to be treated as "no season
    info" during Search's check-import, which silently dropped a
    deliberate Season-0 (Specials) grab whose filename didn't parse — the
    new bool distinguishes "a season was actually picked" from "none
    was," which a bare `int` can never do on its own.
